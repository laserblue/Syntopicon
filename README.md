# The Great Conversation Chatroom
> View and listen to The Great Conversation of the greatest thinkers of the Western world in a chatroom. Chat with your favourite author of a Great Book of the Western World and with supplementary conversational search agents. 

"What binds the authors together in an intellectual community is the great conversation in which they are engaged. In the works that come later in the sequence of years, we find authors listening to what their predecessors have had to say about this idea or that, this topic or that. They not only harken to the thought of their predecessors, they also respond to it by commenting on it in a variety of ways." - Robert M. Hutchins, The Great Conversation, Vol. 1 of the Great Books of the Western World series.

"Syntopicon is an open API of ideas. Inspired by the 1952 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica's Great Books of the Western World, the name was coined by Mortimer J. Adler to describe the jewel of his life's work: a catalogued index of 102 fundamental "great ideas" [Ed. of the Western world] around which competing schools of thought have developed over the past 28 centuries. With over 500,000 references to the works of eminent thinkers [Ed. Of the Western World] from Homer to Shakespeare, Euclid to Einstein [2nd ed. vol. 56], Aristotle to Descartes, the Syntopicon is a monument of academic labor that has fallen into relative obscurity." - John Trecker

This forked project aims to automate the creation of, and interaction with, a Syntopicon in a global Topic-Map-Google-Search-Assistant-type-knowledge-graph way. Note that scholarly tools such as Noet(TM) https://noet.com/ already exist that perform syntopic services across corpora of digital texts, so this project is primarily for educational purposes.

  The Global Syntopicon will include additional Great Ideas from outside the Western world and a much larger inventory of terms. 

  The associated cognitive assistant will read web documents and create an interactive syntopicon.

<!--
## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.


## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc...

## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
